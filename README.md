# LibraryRecordSystem

## Overview

The `Library Record System` is a console-based application designed to manage library operations. The system supports two types of users: librarians and customers. Each user type has distinct functionalities:

- `Librarians` can: add, remove, and manage books, customers, and loans.
- `Customers` can: return books, search for books, and view their current loans.

The application is built using C# and user interaction is handled using the command line.
